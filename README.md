# Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 repo. This project is organized by the Women Coding Community. Through this challenge, I'm committing to completing one Data Camp lesson from the 1st to the 25th of December 2024. The goal is to build consistent coding habits, improve my problem-solving skills, and deepen my understanding of python.

ðŸ“… Challenge Goals
* Build consistent coding habits by completing one lesson from Data Camp everyday.
* Document each topic with learnings, problems and solutions.
